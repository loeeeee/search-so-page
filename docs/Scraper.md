# Scraper

## Overview

Developed by Sichang He, the Scraper is a recursive web crawler used to fetch raw HTML data based on a domain name. Crafted with the efficiency and speed of Rust, this tool forms an integral part of our data acquisition process. 

For a more comprehensive understanding, the documentation and source code can be found **[here](https://github.com/SichangHe/scraper)**. Although it's an independent rewrite of SSO's proprietary scraper and may not match exactly what , it embodies the same spirit and core functionality.
