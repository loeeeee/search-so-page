# Scraper

Developed by Sichang He, the Scraper is a recursive web crawler used to fetch raw HTML data based on a domain name. Crafted with the efficiency and speed of Rust, this tool forms an integral part of our data acquisition process. Although it's an independent rewrite of SSO's proprietary scraper and may not match exactly, it embodies the same spirit and core functionality.
